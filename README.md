# stupid-backend

A stupid backend to test things out. I don't actually know what I'm doing, but why not :P. Planning on using Go with MongoDB for database duties. Probably will make a dart/Flutter plugin at some point.

## Planned Features

* Provide a http.Handler that can be use on any port or address you feel like.
  * Maybe provide a small default runner that runs on a predefined port.
* User count
* User accounts
* User uploaded data
* A really bad looking (optional) website

## Current Features

LOL
